PROBLEMS

- because of the "createdBy" extraaction problem when a user sees the comment he sees himself as the commenter even though he didnt comment it , its bacasue the cuuurent code assign the current user as user.fullname in blogs.ejs instead off comment.createdby.id  -----UPDATE----- = only ._id doesnot work .fullname works
- grid order 3 columns  not appearing
- profileURL 
- "createdBy" in the comments/blog.CREATE cannot access the req.user._id
- the prfileImage url in the "blogs.ejs" needs to be correct with the comment.createdBy.id


--add features = if user.delete, blog also delete
-pfp upload feature
